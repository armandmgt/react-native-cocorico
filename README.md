# Welcome to Cocorico

## How to build
Before to get started there is some requirements to follow.
### Requirements
- You must have `node`, `yarn` and `expo` installed on your machine.
- You also need either an Android emulator or if you're on Mac on iOS emulator ready to start.
- If you plan to run it on your device than you need to download Expo from the store.

### Run localy
To build the project you must first clone the [repo](https://github.com/armandmgt/react-native-cocorico).

After that, from the root of the project launch: `yarn` or `yarn install`.

Finaly start the project with `yarn start`. That's it !

A browser window will open and you can follow the expo instructions to run it either on Android or iOS depending on your machine and device.


### Build the project
Since we used expo in the project, you will have to follow the command line tool of expo to build the app.

#### iOS
In a terminal
```bsh
expo build:ios
```
Then follow the directive of where you want to build it. The easiest will be in a simulator.


#### Android
In a terminal
```bsh
expo build:android
```
Then follow the directive of where you want to build it.

### Help
If you still need some help, I recommend looking on [expo help](https://expo.io/help) or send an email to one of the contributor of the project.


## Deploy
Note that to publish a project you need an expo account.
Once again, here the expo help will be crucial if you want to make something specific.
In a terminal
```bsh
expo publish:set
```

And follow the command tool.

## Enjoy :)
